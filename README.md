# RuboCop Crisalix

> ðŸ’… Ruby styling at Crisalix

Ruby is a beautifully expressive language that embraces and celebrates a variety of dialects. It was never intended to be constrained to a single, uniform style across all libraries and applications.

This collection of RuboCop styles is designed for those who havenâ€™t yet adopted a specific dialect. It provides a reasonable starting point with default rules to help you write consistently styled Ruby code without feeling too constrained.

These rules are neither inherently right nor wrongâ€”they simply reflect the unique aesthetic preferences of the Crisalix Ruby Team. Feel free to use them as-is, propose enhancements, or draw inspiration from them in any way that works for you. The goal is to make your Ruby experience smoother, not stricter.

## Installation

Add this to your Gemfile and run `bundle install`:

```ruby
gem "rubocop-crisalix", require: false, group: [:development]
```

Then add a default `.rubocop.yml` file in the root of your application with:

```yml
inherit_gem:
  rubocop-crisalix: rubocop.yml

# Your custom rules go here
```

Now you can run `bundle exec rubocop` to check for compliance and `bundle exec rubocop -a` to automatically fix violations.
